# Rainfall Nowcasting using LSTM and GCN | ISRO Summer Internship

This repository contains the work done during my **Summer Internship at Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)** from **May 2024 to Aug 2024**. The focus was on analyzing 20 years of rainfall data and developing deep learning models for accurate rainfall nowcasting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 📊 Analyzed 20 years of historical rainfall data
- 🤖 Implemented **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)**
- ⚙️ Fine-tuned model hyperparameters and evaluated performance
- 📈 Compared LSTM and GCN models for accuracy, reliability, and generalization

📌 Key Results

- 📍 Identified the most suitable model for rainfall nowcasting based on RMSE and MAE
- ⏱️ Improved data processing efficiency through optimized model architecture
- ✅ LSTM performed better in temporal analysis, while GCN captured spatial relationships effectively
